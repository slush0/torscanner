* Goal of proposed script is to check data consistency on all Tor network exit nodes.
* It checks only unencrypted traffic on exit nodes (so not HTTPS, FTPS, SSH etc),
* cause on encrypted traffic, there is no (real) possibility to modify content.
* Because script infrastructure is pluggable, there should be easy to extend
* functionality by adding plugin for new protocol.

Algorithms:
===========

first phase - preparation:
--------------------------
* Overview: In this step, script ask each plugin for internet resource,
* which is able to parse/check (html page, ftp file, ...).
* After that, web spider will start searching for these resources on
* Internet (Using Google as start point).
* Spider will stop after reaching limits on links per site, max files or bytes
* downloaded per rule etc.
load web spider conf (start keywords on google,
		max links per site, max files/bytes download per rule, max time, max bytes)
for each plugin:
	retrieve rules (regexs) to protocol/filetype (http:// and *.doc etc)
	add these rules to web spider (will follow only diven regexs)
start web spider
	select one of start keyword
	download google search page
	get links other than google.com to link bucket (check "links per site" limit!)
	while link in bucket:
		select link from bucket
		if exceed "links per site" for this site:
			remove link from bucket
			skip to next link
		if file seems to be any HTTP content:
			download HEADERS of file from link
			if file is html page (Content-Type):
				download and parse file content
				get links from page to link bucket (check "links per site" limit!)
		else (not HTTP protocol):
			headers = empty
		for each plugin:
			skip plugin, if limit of number of files or bytes reached limits
			if file matches to plugin rules (protocol, url, headers)
				add url to plugin's list of matched files
		remove link from bucket
		if spider limits reached (max time, bytes), break
		if limits on every plugins reached, break
for each plugin:
	save plugin's list of matched files

second phase - execution:
-------------------------
connect to tor controller
connect to tor socks proxy
get list of all routers
select running exit nodes, valid?, group them by country
select running relays, uptime > 1day
load check plugins
for each exit node:
	while not valid circuit or tries > 3:
		create 2node circuit "random relay, exit node"
	for each checkPlugin:

third phase - analysis:
-----------------------
* Overview: Target of this phase is to cross-check plugin results of each matched file
* across exit nodes. That means that there is no sharp border between valid and invalid exit node,
* but some probability level of failure. When 99% exit nodes (in each country) returns the same
* content of page and the last one returns something modified, there is probably problem.
* On other side, when only 20% nodes returns the same content, there is big probability, that
* "problem" is on content provider side (dynamic links, time-specific links etc).
* Each script user should consider weights of all aspect and select border level regards
* his own usage of Tor.

Classes:
========
Protocol - implements top-level class for known internet services (HTTP, FTP, SSH)
<XXX>Protocol - has to contain method to retrieve protocol-specific content, eg. SSH.
